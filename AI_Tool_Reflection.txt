We used Claude throughout this project to write the code. Claude helped us create a the Flask application structure, as well as implement queries using pandas. It also gave us options for designing the HTML interface and we chose Tailwind CSS. 
When we got errors, we would describe it to Claude with as much detail as possible and learn how to fix it by adding to or editing certain sections. Throughout the project, we made sure to read through the code Claude provided, try to understand as much as we could, and ask it to clarify any sections that we didn't understand. Testing many different queries also helped us better understand the code. 
Using AI greatly accelerated our learning because we were able to get immediate help instead of being stuck for hours, and we still had to fully understand the logic, test thoroughly and ensure the code was aligned the project instructions. This project taught us Flask programming, deepened our understanding of pandas, and helped us experiment with using AI effectively as a learning tool.
