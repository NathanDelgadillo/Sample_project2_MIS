I used Claude throughout this project to write the code. Claude helped me create a the Flask application structure, as well as implement queries using pandas. It also gave me options for designing the HTML interface and I chose Tailwind CSS. When I got errors, I would describe it to Claude with as much detail as possible and learn how to fix it by adding to or editing certain sections. Throughout the project, I made sure to read through the code Claude provided, try to understand as much as I could, and ask it to clarify any sections that I didn't understand. Testing different many different queries also helped me better understand the code. Using AI greatly accelerated my learning because I was able to get immediate help instead of being stuck for hours, and I still had to fully understand the logic, test thoroughly and ensure the code was aligned the project instructions. This project taught me Flask programming, deepened my understanding of pandas, and helped me experiment with using AI effectively as a learning tool.
